# iNitnem - In Progress: Estimated Completion of 1.0 - March '23

## Introduction
This app is an iOS application developed in Swift using Apple's XCode development simulator. 
I'm aiming it at the senior and less technologically-inclined Sikh-Punjabi community, and is designed to be a companion to help them navigate their daily lives.

## Skills Developed
The development of this app has been a great opportunity for me to strengthen my skills in iOS development and Swift programming language. I am self-taught in Swift and Xcode, so working on this project has increased my confidence in my ability to learn new skills independently.

# App Features
The app includes several features to help the users in their daily lives:

## Google Maps Integration
The app integrates the Google Maps API to display nearby Punjabi points of interest and gurdwaras, making it easy for users to find things nearby.

## Emergency Contact Feature
The app includes an emergency contact feature that allows users to easily access the contact information of their family members in case of an emergency. This feature is designed to help users quickly and easily reach out to their loved ones in times of need.

## Calendar and To-do List
The app includes built-in calendar functionality with a to-do list, making it easy for users to keep track of important dates and tasks. Additionally, the app integrates Punjabi holidays, so users can stay informed about important cultural events.

## SwiftUI
The App is built on top of SwiftUI, the new and modern way of building UI for Apple platforms, it's declarative and reactive, which makes it more efficient and with a better developer experience.

# Conclusion
This project is an ongoing opportunity for me to apply and improve my skills in iOS development and Swift programming. It is allowing me to develop a useful tool for the senior Punjabi community and it is an honor to give back to them in this way. It is also a valuable learning experience for me, as I am continuously developing my self-taught development skills and using modern tools like SwiftUI. Overall, it is an exciting developer experience that not only helps me to build my skills but also serve a community with respect and honor.
